# Hello! 

In this repository I've included three jupyter notebooks: 
- sklearn-train-eval.ipynb : My scikit-learn approach. 
- transformers-train-predict.ipynb : My transformers approach (training/finetuning and predicting the test set)
- transformers-eval.ipynb : My transformers approach (evaluating the model I've saved)

I've included the transformers notebook but I have not tested them on my local machine as I've been utilizing the free CUDA devices on Google Colab.
Please reference the following google colab notebooks!:

Transformers eval: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/121uV9G50MVQWPVevALrh3k-wvp-UxLqy?usp=sharing

Additionally, for consistency I've also included a link to the scikit learn approach as a google colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i3lLAwoD71gBjv3LlLSl_w2ArP5W9LDs?usp=sharing
